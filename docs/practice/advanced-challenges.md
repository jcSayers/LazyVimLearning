These advanced techniques build on solid fundamentals!

## What You'll Master

- **Pattern Replacement** - Use substitution commands for bulk edits
- **Multi-line Editing** - Indent and edit multiple lines efficiently
- **Complex Text Objects** - Combine objects with operators
- **Search Patterns** - Find and replace using regex
- **Marks and Jumps** - Navigate between marked positions
- **Registers** - Copy, store, and paste strategically

## What Makes These Advanced?

### 1. **Pattern-Based Editing**
Use `:s/pattern/replacement/flags` to transform entire lines or sections. This is how professionals edit large files efficiently.

### 2. **Bulk Multi-line Operations**
Instead of editing one line at a time, use > and < to indent multiple lines simultaneously.

### 3. **Combining Complex Concepts**
Mix operators, text objects, and motions to accomplish in a few keystrokes what others need many more.

### 4. **Using Marks and Registers**
Jump between marked positions and store text in registers for precise, non-linear editing.

## Learning Objectives

| Challenge | Concept | Professional Use |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Replace Multiple Words | Substitution (s//g) | Fix repeated typos, refactor variable names |
| Indent Multiple Lines | Count with motion (>2j) | Format code, structure text |
| Complex Text Object | Combined operators (ciw + motion) | Precise code refactoring |
| Find and Replace Pattern | Pattern matching (:s) | Bulk code changes, text transformation |
| Delete Between Marks | Marks and jumps (m, `) | Navigate and edit non-contiguous sections |
| Copy to Register and Paste | Registers ("a) | Advanced copy/paste workflows |

## Tips for Mastering Advanced Techniques

### 1. **Understand the Power of Patterns**
`:s` is one of Vim's most powerful features. Learning regex patterns unlocks enormous productivity gains.

### 2. **Marks and Registers Save Time**
Many users skip these, but professionals use them constantly for navigation and complex editing workflows.

### 3. **Combine Techniques**
The real power of Vim comes from combining operators, text objects, and motions creatively.

### 4. **Think in Motions**
Stop thinking "delete word" and start thinking "delete inside word" (diw) or "delete around word" (daw).

### 5. **Practice with Real Code**
Advanced techniques shine when applied to actual programming tasks. Use them daily.
