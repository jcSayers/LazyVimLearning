## Tips for Success

### Tip 1: Read Instructions Carefully
Each challenge tells you exactly what to do.

### Tip 2: Use Hints Progressively
- **Hint 1**: General guidance about the approach
- **Hint 2**: The specific command name
- **Hint 3**: Exact steps to follow

Try to solve without hints first - you'll learn better!

### Tip 3: Understand the Grammar
Remember: **`[Operator] [Motion]`**
- `d` = delete operator
- `w` = word motion
- `dw` = delete a word

### Tip 4: You Can't Break Anything
The practice editor just compares text. Hit "Reset" anytime to start over. Mistakes are impossible!

### Tip 5: Build Muscle Memory
Type the commands out loud as you do them. Repetition builds automaticity.
