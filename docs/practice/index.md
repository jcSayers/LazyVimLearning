# Practice Hub: Learn by Doing

Welcome to the **interactive practice arena**! Here you'll test your Vim skills with real, hands-on challenges that feel like games.

## How It Works

These are **actual interactive challenges**, not videos or tutorials:

1. **Pick a challenge** - See all available challenges at your skill level
2. **Edit text** to match the goal
3. **Get instant feedback** - The system tells you if you're correct
4. **Use hints** if stuck (progressive help)
5. **Track your progress** - Build confidence as you complete challenges

Your **progress is saved** in your browser and persists across sessions!

|---|---|
| Watch someone code | **You code** |
| Read explanations | **Learn from doing** |
| Passive learning | **Active practice** |
| Can't verify learning | **Instant feedback** |
| Hard to track progress | **Progress tracked** |
| No confidence metric | **See mastery progress** |

## Progress Tracking

Your progress is **automatically saved**:

- ✅ Completed challenges marked
- 📊 Progress bar shows your mastery
- 🎯 View all completed & remaining challenges
- 🔄 Can retry anytime to improve

This is like **keyboard typing tests** - you can see your improvement over time!

## Tips for Maximum Learning

### 1. **Master One Level Before Moving Up**
The challenges build skills sequentially. Don't skip!

### 2. **Use Hints Strategically**
- Try first without hints
- Use hints to understand, not just to pass
- The best learning comes from struggling a bit

### 3. **Do These Daily**
- 10-15 minutes daily beats 2 hours once a week
- Builds muscle memory through repetition
- Confidence grows over time

### 4. **Challenge Yourself**
- Try to complete challenges without hints
- Time yourself (for fun, not stress)
- Retry challenges to improve speed

### 5. **Connect to Real Vim**
- After each challenge, practice in real Vim
- Apply the skill to your actual work
- This makes learning permanent
